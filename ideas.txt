Ideas for the game

Tower Defence

At start:
tent in the middle
woods around
day/night phase - or other indication of attack phase



Day/decisions phase:
- assign people to baracades (people are "currency")
- call support (cost connected)
- 

- build a wall

Walls
- HP/status


turrets have to store whether the're occupied or not




Ending (NECESSARY):
- after N days, and after you pay, a massive wave of monsters appear and a military tank destroys it, player character goes towards tanbk and tank sets off (optional capture of tanbk going in the direction of a sunset)



Optional ideas:
- feeding clones
- bad clones after low quality of machine
- banana skin
