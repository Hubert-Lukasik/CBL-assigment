CBL assignment - game development

SelfDefence game is a tower-defence-like game.
in this game you will have to defend themselves from bigger and bigger waves of opponents.  The game is splitted into “plan” and “defend” phases. During the “plan” phase you are allowed to build new turrets. Enemies will appear only during the “defend” phase. Surviving enemies waves will grant you in-game currency, which can be used to buy defences during the “plan” phase. Surviving at least three attacks and having enough currency will allow a player to end the game, but there will not be a limited amount of waves a player may fight. 
The more attacks a player survives, the higher their score will be when finishing the game. 

Controls:
The player will be controllable by the following keys with their functions:
W - Player moves up
A - Player moves left
S - Player moves down
D - Player moves right
J - Player attack's in the direction it is currently facing

During the plan phase (indicated by the map being daytime) you can build turrets in the shop below the map.
To build a turret, click on the icon with a turret if you have sufficient currency (20) you can place your turret by clicking anywhere (unless there is already somethin there) on the map.
After surviving 3 rounds another butten with a tank should appear, if you have sufficient currency (100) you can click this one and the ending of the game will play, giving you a score.

During the nighttime you will have to fight the opponents, you won't have to think about your turrets because they will funcion by theirself. 
To fight the opponents yourself, stand close to them, face their direction and press J.
Note that you are still allowed to move while attacking, just at a slower pace. 
Opponents will also target your turrets and destroy them so don't rely on them to much!


Quick tips:
-Place turrets mostly in the middle of the map
-Walk backwards as soon as you hit an opponent to get out of range as quick as possible
-Invest in turrets and don't save everything up for the ending, you get increasingly more currency after you survive more rounds
